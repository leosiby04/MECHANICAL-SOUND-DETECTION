# MECHANICAL-SOUND-DETECTION
The goal of the project is to create a system that detects and classifies mechanical sounds, which can indicate potential issues in machinery.
Step 1: Capture Mechanical Sounds: The microphone picks up mechanical sounds, and the ESP32 processes the data.
Step 2: Process and Feed Data to AI Model: The captured sound data is sent to an AI model running on the web browser (TensorFlow.js).
Step 3: Sound Classification: The AI model classifies the sound, detecting whether it matches a predefined mechanical issue.
Step 4: Display Results: The result (e.g., "Motor Overload" or "Bearings Fault") is displayed on the web interface in real-time, providing insights into the detected issue
